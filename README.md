# Sahal CMS

Sahal is an easy to use CMS that can be set up in less than a minute. It uses the MarkDown file format to render them as beautiful HTML sites.

## The Sahal CMS is still under development. The current build has a lot of work that needs to be done. Check back after August 30, 2020 for a more stable beta version.
